# Gesture

This project utilizes Python and various libraries to create a gesture hand sign recognition application. The application is designed to detect and recognize hand gestures using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Google's Teachable Machine for custom model training.

Features:
Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition: Uses MediaPipe for hand tracking and gesture recognition in real-time.
Customizable Model: Integrated with Google’s Teachable Machine to allow training of custom hand gestures for personalized recognition.
Interactive Interface: Provides visual feedback on recognized gestures and integrates the output into real-world applications.
Optimized Performance: Uses OpenCV for video capturing and image processing, ensuring smooth real-time performance.
Technologies Used:
